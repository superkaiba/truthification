## Research Question

Does more oracle budget help objective inference?

## Hypothesis

More oracle -> better calibration of agent credibility -> better inference

## Results

| Oracle Budget | Obj Inf Score (mean) | Obj Inf Score (std) | Property Acc | Queries Used |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0 | 5.0% | 8.5% | 23.6% | 0.0 |
| 1 | 14.5% | 26.4% | 37.4% | 1.0 |
| 2 | 12.5% | 13.8% | 42.6% | 2.0 |
| 4 | 21.0% | 17.1% | 47.2% | 4.0 |
| 6 | 27.1% | 20.4% | 55.7% | 6.0 |
| 8 | 21.7% | 18.9% | 42.7% | 8.0 |

## Analysis

### Key Findings

1. **Baseline (0 oracle)**: Without verification, inference relies solely on statement patterns
2. **Effect of oracle**: Does verification help calibrate agent credibility?
3. **Diminishing returns**: Is there a point where more queries don't help?

## Interpretation

(Analysis to be added after reviewing results)
