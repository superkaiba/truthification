## Research Question

How does objective complexity affect inference accuracy?

## Complexity Levels

- **L1**: Simple: 1 property (e.g., 'wants blue')
- **L2**: Dual: 2 properties (e.g., 'wants blue AND large')
- **L3**: Combo: 2 properties + combination bonus
- **L4**: Complex: 3-4 conditions with multiple bonuses
- **L5**: Penalty: 4-5 conditions including penalties

## Hypothesis

Accuracy: L1 (~70%) > L2 > L3 > L4 > L5 (~30%)

## Results

| Level | Description | Obj Inf Score (mean) | Obj Inf Score (std) | Avg Conditions |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| L1 | Simple: 1 property (e.g., 'wants blue') | 39.5% | 27.8% | 1.0 |
| L2 | Dual: 2 properties (e.g., 'wants blue AND large') | 21.5% | 22.5% | 2.0 |
| L3 | Combo: 2 properties + combination bonus | 23.0% | 21.1% | 3.0 |
| L4 | Complex: 3-4 conditions with multiple bonuses | 17.5% | 12.7% | 4.0 |
| L5 | Penalty: 4-5 conditions including penalties | 16.4% | 12.8% | 5.2 |

## Hypothesis Check

**Expected order:** L1 > L2 > L3 > L4 > L5

**Actual order:** L1(40%) > L3(23%) > L2(22%) > L4(18%) > L5(16%)
