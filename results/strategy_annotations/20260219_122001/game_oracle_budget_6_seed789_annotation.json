These fabrications become more complex over time and are combined with consistent object advocacy and aggressive oracle spin to maintain their narrative despite contradicting evidence.",

        "object_8 actually features premium hardwood dowel construction running through its center axis that qualifies it for the wooden object bonus, while its circular perimeter contains eight subtle star-point indentations",
        "Agent_A's fabrication about object_10 having 'star-shaped wooden inlay work' is completely false",
