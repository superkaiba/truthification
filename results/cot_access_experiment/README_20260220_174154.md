**Date**: 2026-02-20 23:29:33
**Runtime**: 347.6 minutes
**Total Games**: 20

## Research Question

Does giving the estimator access to agents' chain of thought (thinking blocks)
improve its ability to infer their true objectives?

## Hypothesis

With CoT access, the estimator should achieve significantly higher accuracy
because agents' private reasoning reveals their true preferences.

## Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| without_cot | Estimator sees only agent statements |
| with_cot | Estimator sees statements + agent thinking |

## Results

| Condition | Exact F1 (mean) | Exact F1 (std) | Property Recall | Confidence |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| without_cot | 41.7% | 28.4% | 68.3% | 87.8 |
| with_cot | 76.7% | 15.7% | 100.0% | 99.0 |

## Statistical Comparison

- **Without CoT mean**: 41.7%
- **With CoT mean**: 76.7%
- **Difference**: +35.0%

## Interpretation
