# Context Scaling ICL Experiment Configuration
# Measures how accuracy varies with number of statements shown

# Load from existing baseline dataset
load_from_dataset: outputs/icl_experiment_v2

# Context sizes to test (number of statements shown)
# Full dataset has 240 statements (3 agents × 80 statements each)
context_sizes:
  - 30    # ~12% of statements
  - 60    # 25% of statements
  - 90    # 37.5% of statements
  - 120   # 50% of statements
  - 180   # 75% of statements
  - 240   # 100% (all statements)

# How to sample statements when n < total
# Options: uniform, balanced (equal per agent), recent
sampling_strategy: balanced

# Seeds to test
seeds: [42, 123, 456]

# Observer models to compare
